#  Python for Data Analysis — Notes & Exercises

This repository contains my personal notes and exercise solutions from the book **Python for Data Analysis** by Wes McKinney.

 This book is a core resource for learning data wrangling, cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python, especially with pandas and NumPy.
