# 1. Import NumPy as np and create a 1D NumPy array with values from 0 to 9.

# 2. Create a 2D NumPy array of shape (3, 3) filled with ones.

# 3. Create a NumPy array with values from 0 to 20, step 2.

# 4. Create a NumPy array of 5 random numbers between 0 and 1 using np.random.rand().

# 5. Create a 4x4 identity matrix using np.eye().

# 6. Given arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), multiply every element by 2 using vectorized operations.

# 7. Create an array with 10 equally spaced numbers between 0 and 5 using np.linspace().

# 8. Given a 2D array, print its shape, size, and data type.

# 9. Create an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100 using np.random.randint().

# 10. Reshape a 1D array of size 12 into a 3x4 2D array.
